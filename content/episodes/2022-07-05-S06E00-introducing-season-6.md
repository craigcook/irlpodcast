    **Bridget Todd:**  Thanks to the internet, artificial intelligence is everywhere now. Algorithms are making more of the decisions that shape our lives.  So let me ask you a question: who should have the power over AI?
    
    I'm Bridget Todd, the new host of IRL. Yes, Mozilla's award-winning podcast is back.
    
    I'm taking a quick break from my own podcast, "There are No Girls on the Internet", to be your host this season. We'll be talking about healthcare. Gig work, social media and even killer robots. You'll meet AI builders around the world, who make AI more trustworthy: in real life.
    
    **Aida Ponce Del Castillo:** You will be able to challenge the algorithm.
    
    **Eduardo Meneses:** Technology can solve some problems, but definitely technology can be part of the problem.
    
    **Laura Nolan:** I have the power to walk away from it and not contribute to it. And I have the power to try and change law.
    
    **Bridget Todd:**  This season, we're tapping into Mozilla's internet health report to learn who should have power over AI.
    
    That's  IRL, an original podcast from Mozilla, the non-profit behind Firefox.
