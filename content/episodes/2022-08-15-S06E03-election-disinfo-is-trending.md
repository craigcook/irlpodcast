    **Hostname:** Hey, it's me. And before we start this episode, I need to ask you for some feedback. The IRL team and I are wondering what specific issues, questions, or stories you have about privacy, security, and online life. Please find a link to a short survey on the podcast website. It's in the show notes at irlpodcast.org. We don't share any of your data with anyone else and your answers go directly to the humans who make IRL. Irlpodcast.org, find the survey, talk to us about all things IRL. Okay, thank you.

    Lately, the big tech companies have been talking a big game about their commitment to privacy...

    **Mark Zuckerberg:** Privacy gives us the freedom to be ourselves.

    **Hostname:** Sure, I totally agree. Thank you.
