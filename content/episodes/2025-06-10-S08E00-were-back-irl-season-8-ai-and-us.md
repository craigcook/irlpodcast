    **Bridget Todd:** Every day, the news is full of stories about AI. How it's changing everything. But what does that really mean for you and me? I'm Bridget Todd, host of IRL, Mozilla Foundation's award-winning podcast. Welcome to our new season: AI and Us. We're talking to people who are reshaping AI from the personal to the planetary. Inside our brains...

    **Ian Burkhart:** Instead of having your keyboard and mouse or touchscreen or trackpad, it's coming directly from your brain.

    **Bridget Todd:** In our relationships.

    **Jen Caltrider:** Oh gosh, does ChatGPT being used for sexual roleplay worry me?

    **Bridget Todd:** And in our cities.

    **Marina Otero Verzier:** If a new data center will be built in Madrid, where I live, I will be very concerned about the water usage.

    **Bridget Todd:** It's AI and Us on IRL. Go find IRL on your favorite podcast app right now.

    IRL is an original podcast from Mozilla Foundation with PRX.
