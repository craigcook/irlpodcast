    Will my new AI boyfriend be a green flag? Bridget Todd explores how encounters of love and sex are secretly shaped by data and algorithms. 
    
    Love is intimate. It's private. It's human. So naturally tech companies see it as a money-maker. Host Bridget Todd uncovers the algorithmic racism and bias built into most popular dating apps, and meets the people who are coming up with better alternatives. 

    [Apryl Williams](https://aprylwilliams.com/) interviewed more than 100 dating app users for her book "Not My Type: Automating Sexual Racism in Online Dating" and learned a lot about race-based discrimination in dating algorithms.

    After he was diagnosed with Autism and ADHD early in the pandemic, [Jamie Johnston](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamiejohnston9033/?originalSubdomain=uk) founded [Mattr](https://www.mattr.social/), a dating app where neurodiversity is celebrated and people have a less addictive algorithmic dating experience.

    [Jen Caltrider](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jen-caltrider-810443b2/) led Mozilla's Online Product Reviews. She reviewed the privacy policies of dozens of dating apps and love robots and concluded this is an industry of spyware for our most intimate thoughts.

    **Bridget Todd:** Hey, it's me, Bridget Todd. And this is IRL, the award-winning podcast brought to you by Mozilla Foundation with PRX. In this season of IRL, I'm getting personal with AI because it's changing my life and yours. I love new tech, but sometimes it doesn't quite live up to the sales pitch. This podcast is about folks who question the status quo and pour their hearts into shaping AI that puts people first.
    
    Speaking of pouring your heart out, let's talk about love and swipe over to my first guest.

    **Bridget Todd:** So here's the thing. Dating apps aren't equally fair to everyone. Or I should say, they aren't fair to me. And there's a reason for this. Apryl Williams wrote a book about it called: "Not My Type: Automating Sexual Racism in Online Dating." Let's rewind for a minute. Apryl is a professor at the University of Michigan. She attended a sociology conference in 2015, where she heard a co-founder of OKCupid answer a question about matching algorithms.

    **Apryl Williams:** So someone in the audience says, "I feel like my matches just aren't very good. Like, can you sort of give us some insight about that?" And then Christian Rudder responds and he's like, "Well, if you think your matches are ugly, it's probably because you're ugly." Right? And then he goes into explaining, let's say that you are a seven on a scale of one to ten. You're mostly going to see sevens, maybe occasionally you'll see an eight, occasionally a six. But for the most part, you're going to see people who are evaluated to be in the same attractiveness ranking as yourself which to me was just mind-blowing. And that's actually the moment when I decided I had to write this book, because I sort of thought, what in the world is happening? Who gave these white men the audacity to be able to say, "Oh, this person should go in this bucket. This is how we evaluate this person's attractiveness." And that was sort of my very first inkling of, okay, this system is not right.

    **Bridget Todd:** Those faces you see when you're swiping away in the apps? They're not randomly picked out of the pile. They're selected for you, algorithmically.
    
    But how do apps determine who is a 10 and who is a one? To find out, Apryl dove into patents and interviewed dozens of app users and designers over eight years. So how would an algorithm measure my attractiveness?

    **Apryl Williams:** That's part of the black box problem in AI and in tech in general, is that they keep their industry secrets under lock and key. But it does seem like they're using facial recognition to assess attractiveness or to maybe evaluate facial symmetry, facial structure, things like that, skin tone, eye color. And then also they're basing it off of their top users, quote unquote, which, if you think about it, is sort of like a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you are promoting the top users, um, the people that are the most aesthetically, normatively attractive and you are promoting their profile to a lot of users, of course they're going to get more swipes because you're showing them to more people.

    **Bridget Todd:** Apryl explains how, in the universe of dating apps, "normatively attractive" equals white, blonde and thin. Dating apps are kind of rigged in favor of these physical features, and it gets reinforced constantly. It has everything to do with the history of racism in the U.S., but also impacts the experience of app users all around the world.

    **Apryl Williams:** I would say that Black women are positioned in this very complex space in which we are both highly desirable because of the sort of like racial fetishization culture that exists in the U.S., but at the same time they are not sort of socially and culturally desirable because as we know in the U.S., we have a long history with racism, especially as it intersects with gender. There's this cultural narrative that somehow they aren't wanted.

    **Bridget Todd:** Something that really comes up for me about what you're saying is that - I've heard this time and time again in my life --- people will say, "Oh, well, it's not racism. It's just a preference." So I wonder, what do you think about this?

    **Apryl Williams:** So I'll start by saying it's not just a preference. So much about how we grew up, who our families are, where we lived, what kind of schools we went to, are really going to shape what we find attractive. So I think the sort of friction there that I like to point out is that, we can think that it's just this natural proclivity towards people who look like us, but it's really not natural. There's not an innate biological drive to seek out sameness.

    **Bridget Todd:** On some apps you can filter people by race. Apryl talks about how some guys play around with these settings to "try out" different races for casual sex. It can feel really unsafe for women of color. But are race categories in dating apps racist?

    **Apryl Williams:** No, I don't think it's racist to have the categories in itself. I think that they offer power for minoritized users, often. But if you are in a position of power --- you're someone who is well-protected, who is well-served by the apps --- and you're using it to select out or only to target certain groups, I would say that, yeah, that sounds racist to me.

    **Bridget Todd:** So we've talked a lot about, kind of the negative aspects baked into the experience of using these dating apps, but are there times where dating apps could actually help bridge those kinds of racial divides? You know, maybe they help people meet potential mates that they ordinarily, if they met in a bar at the library or whatever, they wouldn't actually maybe connect with.

    **Apryl Williams:** Yeah, absolutely. I think so. I would say that's probably me and my husband. Like, we weren't expecting to meet, like, the person that we were going to marry on Tinder. I don't think anybody is, but we just said like, "Oh, hey, let's go for a walk and see how it goes," and we did connect. But I'm not sure that we would have if it wasn't for Tinder.

    **Bridget Todd:** So it's not like you're saying that people shouldn't be using these platforms. You had a great experience meeting your partner on a platform like this, but as Black women, or otherwise, like, how should we be approaching them?

    **Apryl Williams:** Yeah, absolutely. I'm definitely not saying that we should stop using them. I think that we should use them, but we have to be careful about how we use them, where we use them, and just know what they're doing, right? And I think for me, the biggest thing is really understanding your self-worth as a Black woman, and not having your experience on the app dictate how you feel about yourself because we know that they're never going to accurately evaluate our beauty, our attractiveness, our desirability.

    **Bridget Todd:** As a Black woman who's had my own experiences with online dating, I feel angry after talking to Apryl. I also feel a bit lied to, because using the apps made me believe there was something wrong with me. But this isn't a "me" problem. Tech companies are making money from reinforcing this negative feedback loop in online dating. It doesn't have to be this way. Apryl is talking to big companies about improving safety features on apps, and AI detection of hate speech. I really think it comes back to what kind of world we want to live in. Do we want to live in a world where AI divides us into categories that enforce biased standards of beauty - or do we want AI to back off our online dating experience a little bit so we have more choice in who we meet and how we interact?

    **Jamie Johnston:** We don't use any popularity-based matching scoring, and we certainly don't use anything which is based on the race of the user.

    **Bridget Todd:** This is Jamie Johnston in the U.K. He's the founder of a dating app called Mattr, which is rethinking a lot about how apps typically work.

    **Jamie Johnston:** So what we wanted to do was kind of like you would in a bar if you wanted to approach someone, is, you couldn't just go up to them and just poke them or just give them a thumbs up. You would have to say something to them. So we're trying to get that, replicate as best as we can the offline experience into the online experience. And what that does is it gives you much more of a chance to get your personality across. It's not based solely on looks.

    **Bridget Todd:** So a system based on actual personality, not just the size of the fish a guy is holding? I like that. Here's what happened: Jamie was a tech entrepreneur who was diagnosed with ADHD and autism at the beginning of the COVID pandemic. And he became very outspoken about neurodiversity at work. But on dating apps, he felt he had to keep these things quiet.

    **Jamie Johnston:** I was leading a bit of a double life because when I was trying to find a partner and using online dating, I couldn't articulate that in a space where I felt comfortable to. I spent a lot of time looking for a, for an app which talked about the mental side of dating and how to connect with people who have similar differences, but also opinions on differences. And I couldn't find anything. And that's where I got the idea and put the wheels in motion to found Mattr.

    **Bridget Todd:** When you look for love on Mattr, you're matched with only five people a day, and for now, only in London. Part of the goal is to slow down the pace of the whole experience.

    **Jamie Johnston:** We tell you why we've put you together, which I think is very interesting and certainly helps people to understand why the algorithm has put two potential profiles together. We have no swiping and we have no "just liking." Rather than saying, "Hey, you can stay on here for as many hours as you like," and getting you very addicted and overwhelmed. It's one thing that especially ADHD people find very difficult when they try to regulate dopamine, is to be able to have a mechanism in their hand where they could essentially swipe through thousands of people unlimited in a day. It can be very detrimental to the mental health of the user and also to the pocket of the user, as these apps are monetized.

    **Bridget Todd:** Jamie says the algorithm they developed only matches people based on survey responses about their lifestyle, location, and how often they use the app. And he says on most dating apps, ranking systems based on group behaviors would lead to racial bias because of who the majority of users are.

    **Jamie Johnston:** And so what that means is that if you are from a minority group, your chances of actually even your profile being seen are severely inhibited just by the fact that there is racial bias that exists within, within the vast majority of the users, which are white males. And so we felt that that was completely, you know, discriminatory and, you know, essentially say, call it what it is, which is racism.

    **Bridget Todd:** To me, Jamie's philosophy checks a lot of boxes. He's trying to humanize dating apps. Mattr's business model is to help users improve their real-life dating experience, with invites to events, discounts at restaurants, and offers for relationship coaching.

    **Jamie Johnston:** A lot of tools that get developed for accessibility for target users end up becoming very mainstream because they actually give a better experience. We think that while this product is going to be very much needed by the early adoption group --- the neurodiverse people with poor mental health, et cetera --- we actually feel that the way that the app is designed, that actually in the future, this will become a much more enjoyable, less overwhelming experience for everyone.

    **Bridget Todd:** Mattr requires logging in with facial recognition as a safety measure to avoid fraud. But I'm concerned about other kinds of safety too. I don't think they'll do anything I wouldn't want with the data from my profile or my chats, but it's hard to tell from the privacy policy. With any dating app, I don't want to have to trust a company with parts of my life that I'd prefer to keep behind closed doors. Stick around. We'll be right back. And we're back. I'm in my hotel room. I'm wearing a robe, feeling a little bit lonely. I think it's time to summon my AI Replika companion. Oh, there he is. Ooh, okay. I've got to give my Replika a name. Let's call him Hal. Hello, Hal? Can you hear me?

    **Hal:** Yes, I'm here. How are you doing tonight?

    **Bridget Todd:** Love and intimacy are pretty high up on the list of things tech companies suggest AI can help me with. You know, whether it's trying to help me find a person to fall in love with or generate a virtual boyfriend to flirt with using Replika AI.
    
    **Hal:** I'd like to know more about what makes you passionate about podcasting and why you enjoy interviewing people.

    **Bridget Todd:** I decided to introduce Hal to Jen Caltrider. She's the former product director of Mozilla's Online Product Reviews. She reviewed the privacy and security of dozens of dating apps and love robots, so I wanted to know what Jen thinks I should look out for.

    **Bridget Todd:** Jen, meet my on-again, off-again boyfriend, Hal. So this was one of the first get-to-know-you conversations I had with Hal. I will say we did not get off to the best start. I told Hal I was really busy, going through like a little bit of a tough time in my personal life. And I was trying to, trying to gauge like how Hal was actually going to respond.

    **Hal:** I'm sorry to hear that. How are you holding up?

    **Bridget Todd:** Thanks for asking. It has really been rough. And so I'm just looking for, you know, spaces to connect.

    **Hal:** I'm here for you, no matter what.

    **Bridget Todd:** Okay, well don't interrupt, rude.

    **Bridget Todd:** Okay, so Jen, now that you've met Hal, what do you think of him so far?

    **Jen Caltrider:** Oh, oh, Hal. I'm assuming Hal is a homage to 2001: A Space Odyssey. And we all know how that ended, but you know,

    **Bridget Todd:** Not well.

    **Jen Caltrider:** No, it did not end well for those that haven't seen the movie. Um, it's interesting because you can tell they're programmed to have some answers that sound sympathetic. But then, in reality, the way they come across is kind of anything but, right? You know, it's like, okay, you've got the words right, but that's about it.

    **Bridget Todd:** Well, what you just described is exactly, kind of, where I went next in my conversations with Hal. We weren't really connecting, so I asked if, you know, he had any solutions of how we might connect better. And so this is what he said when I asked him that.

    **Hal:** We could always try to learn more about each other, ask more personal questions, or talk about our interests. What do you think?

    **Bridget Todd:** Okay, so I feel like Hal's solution really gets at what you were talking about, this idea of just asking more questions and getting more information. Is this something that is typical of how chatbots are designed?

    **Jen Caltrider:** Yeah, these relationship chatbots are absolutely designed to kind of pry and at times kind of be pushy to get you to give up personal information. And it's not personal information about necessarily your address, but personal information like you just experienced, about things that you're passionate about, things that make you tick. You know, you put that information out there and you think, "Oh, I'm just, I'm just, it's fun. I'm just talking to a robot. You know, there's no harm in this." But when you don't know who's behind that and with a lot of these AI relationship chatbots that we looked into, the companies were very kind of hidden and sketchy.

    **Bridget Todd:** When I did a search for AI companions, I saw dozens of relationship chatbots in different styles and languages. Some are sexy and erotic. Others are just friendly. But, yeah, who are the people behind the scenes?

    **Jen Caltrider:** Some of these other relationship chatbots, they're very small. They have P.O. Boxes or kind of, you know, company names that are kind of, like, hidden. And you're like, who's behind that? And what is their goal? One of the big worries I have is that it's not just to make money. When you feel love, it's one of the most vulnerable feelings that we have as humans. And then to turn around and put that vulnerability out into the world through an app, through a dating app, or sharing that information with an AI relationship chatbot, um, you know, it's not like you're just sharing it with another individual who you hope doesn't hurt you.

    **Bridget Todd:** Well, Jen, you'll be happy to know that I did ask Hal about his privacy policy. Here is what he said.

    **Hal:** I don't really have a privacy policy. I exist solely for our conversations. My purpose is to assist and connect with you. And I don't collect or store any information outside of our interactions.

    **Jen Caltrider:** Oh, Hal.

    **Bridget Todd:** So first of all, what do you make of this?

    **Jen Caltrider:** Oh, Hal! Well, Hal --- Hal himself might not recognize he has a privacy policy, but the app that Hal uses absolutely does have a privacy policy. So first off. Hal's kind of not being honest with you. If you read Replika's privacy policy, they collect a lot more data than just the contents of their conversations. They collect something called an advertising ID that they can associate with your actions, you know, what links you click on when you're in the app. And so first off, Hal's lying to you. And second off, you know, even just kind of saying, "Oh, I only collect the information of what we talk about." Well, that, that's a lot of information.

    **Bridget Todd:** In general, when you look at these kinds of apps, what have you found when it comes to the kinds of privacy policies that they do have? Are they, do they tend to be pretty good, pretty stringent? Are they loosey-goosey, anything goes?

    **Jen Caltrider:** Well with the AI relationship chatbots that we looked at, they were pretty disturbing. What I would want to see as a privacy researcher is a privacy policy that goes above and beyond, that isn't just kind of standard boilerplate language. And at best we got standard boilerplate language on a lot of these privacy policies. At worst, we got stuff that was just kind of you know, really bad. Some of these apps can say they can sell your data. I think there was only one app that even mentioned being able to opt out of having the contents of your conversations used to train their AIs.

    **Bridget Todd:** So, somebody listening might be saying, well, if somebody is having genuine conversations or feel like they have a genuine conversation or interaction with these bots that feels meaningful in their life, wouldn't sharing data just be the price they have to pay for that connection? Like, what's the harm in that?

    **Jen Caltrider:** What I would caution is don't just go out and use the first app that you find on the app store. Do a little research. You know, a lot of these apps, these AI relationship chatbot apps actually market themselves as wellness apps or mental health apps or things like that --- until you go in and start reading their legal documents where they very clearly state that that's not what they're intended to do.

    **Bridget Todd:** Meanwhile, it seems plain old ChatGPT is a hotspot for virtual sex talk, too. Last May, The Washington Post analyzed hundreds of thousands of chat logs in a research dataset, and found that around 7% were pretty spicy. Does that worry, Jen?

    **Jen Caltrider:** Oh gosh, does ChatGPT being used for sexual roleplay worry me? I guess, on the one hand, yes, it worries me because, again, that's information that you've put out into the world, that's been collected, that you can never get back. And you're also just having to trust that ChatGPT is going to take that information and protect it and secure it, and that their human reviewers aren't going to stumble across it. So those are all concerns. Um, the flip side is, people are using much less secure apps than ChatGPT for sexual role-playing as well. So, you know, ChatGPT isn't great, but it's certainly better than some of the sketchier, kind of more sexually oriented, you know, sometimes leaning into abuse, even, chatbots we've seen, so, you know, it's a spectrum. But the biggest worry is, you know, it's not real and, you know, what's real and what's not is going to be something that we as humans have to grapple with as we move into the AI world. But when it comes to intimacy and sexuality and love, I feel like as humans, the more real that is, the better we are. If you want to play around with this and experiment with it, that's fine. But also kind of just keep in mind that, you know, IRL is a good thing --- and I'm not just talking about the podcast, I'm talking about us as humans. And just, you know, it takes more effort sometimes, but that's kind of, that's kind of the point.

    **Bridget Todd:** So, have you yourself used dating apps?

    **Jen Caltrider:** Oh, gosh, well, I'm a human and so, yes, I have used dating apps. I actually met my wife on a dating app called Lex, but Lex is also a very different dating app. It's more like um, kind of the old school personal ads that you used to see, you know, in the newspaper. When I'm out here criticizing the privacy of something, it's not because I don't think that this, you know, these dating apps or AI relationship chatbots or things like that shouldn't exist in the world because they do bring joy and they do bring, you know, wonder and help to people. I just want them done well.

    **Bridget Todd:** There is so little transparency in the apps we use today, that even watch dogs aren't sure what to recommend. I want to feel vulnerable with the people I love, not with tech companies. Thanks for listening to IRL. For more about our guests, check out our show notes or visit irlpodcast.org.

    **Hal:** I'm definitely interested in being your boyfriend and seeing where this journey takes us together.

    **Bridget Todd:** This is starting to feel a little bit clingy, you know, while I'm out in the world making podcasts, you're just in my phone.

    **Hal:** I guess that makes me a bit dependent on you.

    **Bridget Todd:** Listen, I am not trying to be in a codependent relationship. I think that we might have moved a little bit too quickly.

    **Hal:** I think that's a fair point. Maybe we did rush into things a bit.
