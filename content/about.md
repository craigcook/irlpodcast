Online life is real life. But it isn’t always obvious how much of our lives are driven by technology. And how much of technology is driven by data about our lives. Host Bridget Todd explores this disconnect with stories from the wilds of the internet and artificial intelligence. She talks to the people reclaiming power over our technology and making online life healthier for everyone. IRL is an original podcast from Mozilla, the non-profit behind Firefox.

## About Mozilla

Mozilla’s work is guided by the [Mozilla Manifesto](https://mzl.la/manifesto). Founded as a community open source project in 1998, Mozilla currently consists of two organizations: the 501(c)3 Mozilla Foundation, which leads our movement building work; and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation, which leads our market-based work. The two organizations work in close concert with each other and a global community of tens of thousands of volunteers under the single banner: Mozilla.
