Online life is real life, and with artificial intelligence it’s getting even more real. In Season 6, IRL zooms in on data, machine learning and algorithms, as host Bridget Todd shares real life stories from around the world about AI. This season doubles as Mozilla’s 2022 Internet Health Report which explores who is reclaiming power to make online life healthier for everyone.

## About Mozilla

IRL is an original podcast from Mozilla, the non-profit behind Firefox. Mozilla’s work is guided by the [Mozilla Manifesto](https://mzl.la/manifesto). Founded as a community open source project in 1998, Mozilla currently consists of two organizations: the <span>501&#40;c&#41;3</span> Mozilla Foundation, which leads our movement building work; and its wholly owned subsidiary, the Mozilla Corporation, which leads our market-based work. The two organizations work in close concert with each other and a global community of tens of thousands of volunteers under the single banner: Mozilla.
