<i>IRL: Online Life is Real Life</i> is an original podcast from [Mozilla](https://foundation.mozilla.org), the non-profit behind Firefox. We build tech and support movements to reclaim the internet. Our mission is to make the internet healthier, and to make artificial intelligence more trustworthy.

Season 7 of IRL coincides with Mozilla’s 25th anniversary and explores how to build artificial intelligence that puts <i>people</i> ahead of profit.

IRL originally launched in 2017 and was hosted by [Veronica Belmont](https://veronicabelmont.com/) for three seasons, followed by two seasons hosted by [Manoush Zamrodi](http://www.manoushz.com/).

In 2022, IRL relaunched with Season 6 as a special edition of Mozilla’s [Internet Health Report](https://2022.internethealthreport.org/) hosted by [Bridget Todd](https://www.instagram.com/bridgetmarieindc/).
